## Our motivation

As college students, we understand how difficult it can be to ask for help to navigate our college lives, be it academics, making friends, or just asking to borrow a racquet for tennis. Sometimes, in our confusion, we seek help from pages like NYUAD Room of Requirement, however, posting on social media can be a very intimidating task, not to mention inefficient - not many people who scroll RoR are looking to help (we know cuz we've been there!). We wanted to create a platform for all NYUAD students to facilitate asking for help.

## Solutions
The website is a platform that aims to facilitate offering help and providing help. Students can post their need for help on the website along with rewards they want to give, while they can also offer help by accepting other's request. In return for other's help, one has to list their offering when they post a request for help. The offering can be anything that can be bought by campus dirhams, flex dirhams, meal swipes, and falcon dirhams (or even real money!).
